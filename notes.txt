## Todo:

5) Such a macroexpand-hook system will have to handle the case where the codebase under instrumentation doesn't contain the `defgeneric` forms, but only raw `defmethod`s. So perhaps check on each eligible `defmethod` form whether to generate
a suitable `defgeneric`.
-- This can be done in a MOPy fashion by inspecting the available methods/the generic function definition, to see if e.g. a superaround confirming to the lambda-list exists. So should be possible without any new awkward tables etc.
6) Update README and package definition, hehe
- DEFRECFUN & DEFRECGENERIC both supported
- describe the programmer interface (:test, :custom-test, :strategy, macroexpand-hook using setup)...
- all the stuff in config.lisp, obviously, including *record-conditions*
7) Try out actual usage in a codebase
