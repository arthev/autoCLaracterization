## Todo:

6) Update README and package definition, hehe
- DEFRECFUN & DEFRECGENERIC both supported (and DEFRECMETHOD too in case defgeneric form's missing)
- describe the programmer interface (:test, :custom-test, :strategy, macroexpand-hook using setup)...
- all the stuff in config.lisp, obviously, including *record-conditions*
- also improve names overall (e.g. hook-args fns are poorly named)
- have a pass to look for things to refactor
-- the various test cases that use remove-fn because of restart troubles could
       probably benefit from refactoring to use `with-redefinition-mimicker`.

7) Try out actual usage in a codebase
